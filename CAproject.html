        <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism">WikiPedia</a> "Plagiarism" is the representation of another person's language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions as one's own original work. Although precise definitions vary depending on the institution, in many countries and cultures plagiarism is considered a violation of academic integrity and journalistic ethics, as well as social norms around learning, teaching, research, fairness, respect, and responsibility.</p>
